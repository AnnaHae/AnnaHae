# AnnaHaenchen

Hello,

my name is Anna. 
IÂ´m a 33-year old Engineer from Germany, currently working in the Automtive Industry as project lead for production.

Willing to change my career to work more independent and remote, I started my data science learning journey in July 2020.



Feel free to add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annahaenchen/) and watch my progress :nerd_face:.
